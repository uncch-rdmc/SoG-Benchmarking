== From today's meeting


* For the selection page, we would like:
** [ ] An option to display only the raw data, perhaps via a checkbox, which when selected would make the dropdown for the denominator options disappear.
** [x] Remove the word “Project” in the title
** [x] Remove the “Instructions” tab
** [x] It should come with a preloaded graph instead of a blank space
** [x] Change “peerGroup” to “Comparison Municipalities”
** [x] Change “variable” to “Service Metric”
** [x] Capitalize “denominator variable” to “Denominator Variable”
** Pre-populate
*** [x] the service metric
*** context variable
** Add full names for:
*** [x] Services
*** [x] Service metrics
*** [x] Denominator variables
** [x] Replace the title with the service metric/denominator variable
** [x] Hide the confusing options for the graph
 

* As for what needs to be changed on the PDF, we would like:
** [x] The Base Municipality selection should be displayed below the graph.
** [x] The service should also be displayed below the graph.
** [x] The comparison municipalities should be displayed when the average is on the graph.
** [x] The title should be changed to just display the numerator and denominator (and if it is too long, we can have the numerator on one line and the denominator on the other)
*** This doesn’t need to say “metric”
** [x] The “value” label is not needed
** The “caption field” label below is not needed. [customization necessary]
** [x] Remove semicolons at the end of the lines

** [ ] Legend's text should be the name of q
 
* [x] Lastly, we also discussed integrating the dashboard onto the website. Is there any update from your coworker about that?
